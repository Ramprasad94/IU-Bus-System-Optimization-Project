# IU-Bus-System-Optimization-Project
A repository containing the code and final report for the IU Bus System Optimization Project

IU Bus route optimization project focuses on improving the efficiency
of the Indiana University Bus transport system running on the
Indiana University â€“ Bloomington campus. Owing to the increasing
student enrollment at the University over the years, the burden on the
existing infrastructure to serve the needs of the commuters has grown
proportionally.
The IU Bus route optimization project provides a methodology to
adapt to the increasing demand by studying the existing data from
daily usage and suggesting schedule modifications and optimum usage
of existing resources. The project also focuses on on-time delivery of
buses to their respective stops with appreciable reduction in travel
times. The data that was used to perform analysis on was real time
data collected over a period of time during the academic year 2014-
2015.
We transformed the data and performed analysis on the data. We
calculated the average differences between actual times and scheduled
times(variance) between any two consecutive stops for all the routes
and also the average for each days and tried to understand the relation
between variance, weather and passenger count.
